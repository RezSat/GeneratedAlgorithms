## Title: Weighted Random Walk

## Description:
This algorithm performs a random walk on a list of numbers, where the probability of choosing a number is weighted by its absolute value.

## Algorithm Explanation:
The algorithm takes a list of numbers and a number of steps as input. In each step, it calculates weights based on the absolute values of the numbers. It then chooses a number based on these weights and adds it to the total.

## The Full Code:
```python
import random

def weighted_random_walk(numbers, steps):
    """
    Performs a weighted random walk on a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of numbers to walk on.
        steps: The number of steps to take.

    Returns:
        The final total after the random walk.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return 0

    total = 0
    for _ in range(steps):
        # Calculate weights based on the numbers
        weights = [abs(num) for num in numbers]  # Use absolute values for weights
        
        # Handle the case where all weights are zero
        if sum(weights) == 0:
            index = random.randint(0, len(numbers) - 1)
        else:
            # Normalize weights to create a probability distribution
            probabilities = [weight / sum(weights) for weight in weights]
            
            # Choose an index based on the probabilities
            index = random.choices(range(len(numbers)), weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]
        
        total += numbers[index]

    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, -4, 5]
    steps = 1000
    result = weighted_random_walk(numbers, steps)
    print(f"The final total after {steps} steps is: {result}")
```

## How to Use:
The code can be run directly from the command line.  No special instructions are needed.

## Expected Output:
The expected output is the final total after the random walk. The value will vary due to the random nature of the algorithm, but should be centered around a value determined by the input list.

## Conclusion:
The Weighted Random Walk algorithm provides a way to perform a random walk where the probability of choosing a number is weighted by its absolute value. This can be useful in situations where you want to bias the random walk towards certain numbers.
