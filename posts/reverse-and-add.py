# Title: Reverse and Add
# Description: This algorithm takes an integer as input, reverses it, and adds the reversed number to the original number. If the result is not a palindrome, repeat the process until it becomes a palindrome or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

# How to Use:
# Call the function reverse_and_add(n) with an integer argument.

# Expected Output:
# reverse_and_add(121) == 121
# reverse_and_add(123) == 444
# reverse_and_add(195) == 9339

# Conclusion:
# The algorithm successfully finds a palindrome by reversing and adding a number to itself.
