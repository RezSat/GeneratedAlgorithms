# Cellular Automata with Random Rules

##  Description

This algorithm implements a 1D cellular automaton where the rules for cell updates are randomly generated.

## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm works as follows:

1.  Initialize a 1D array of cells with random states (e.g., 0 or 1).
2.  Generate a random rule set. A rule set is a dictionary that maps the neighborhood configuration of a cell (e.g., the states of the cell and its immediate neighbors) to the new state of the cell.
3.  For a specified number of generations:
    *   Update the state of each cell based on its neighborhood configuration and the rule set.
    *   Display the current generation of cells.

## The Full Code

```python
import random

def cellular_automata(size, generations):
    # Initialize the cells with random states
    cells = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(size)]

    # Generate a random rule set (neighborhood configuration -> new state)
    rules = {}
    for i in range(8):  # 8 possible neighborhood configurations (2^3)
        rules[bin(i)[2:].zfill(3)] = random.randint(0, 1)

    def get_neighborhood(index):
        # Get the states of the cell and its neighbors
        left = cells[index - 1] if index > 0 else cells[-1]  # Wrap around
        right = cells[index + 1] if index < size - 1 else cells[0]  # Wrap around
        center = cells[index]
        return str(left) + str(center) + str(right)

    # Run the simulation for the specified number of generations
    for _ in range(generations):
        new_cells = cells[:]  # Create a copy to store the new generation

        for i in range(size):
            neighborhood = get_neighborhood(i)
            new_cells[i] = rules[neighborhood]

        cells = new_cells
        print("".join(["#" if cell == 1 else " " for cell in cells])) # Display the generation

# Example usage:
# cellular_automata(50, 20)
```

## How to Use

To use the algorithm, call the `cellular_automata` function with the desired size of the cell array and the number of generations to simulate.

## Expected Output

The output will be a series of lines representing the evolution of the cellular automaton over time. Each line will show the states of the cells in a generation, with "#" representing a cell in state 1 and " " representing a cell in state 0. The patterns will vary greatly due to the random rule set.

## Conclusion

This "Cellular Automata with Random Rules" algorithm demonstrates the complex and unpredictable behavior that can arise from simple rules and local interactions.
