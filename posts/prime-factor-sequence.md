## Description
This algorithm generates a sequence of prime factors for a given number. For example, if the number is 12, the sequence will be [2, 2, 3].

## Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm finds the prime factors of a given number by iteratively dividing the number by the smallest prime number until the number becomes 1.

## The Full Code
```python

    Generates a sequence of prime factors for a given number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number for which to generate the prime factors.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the prime factors of the number.

# How to Use: Run the script with the desired number as an argument.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    number = 12  # You can change this value
    factors = prime_factor_sequence(number)
    print("Prime Factors:", factors)

# Expected Output:
# Prime Factors: [2, 2, 3]

# Conclusion: This script generates the sequence of prime factors for a given number.
```

## How to Use
The script can be run directly from the command line. You can modify the `number` variable in the script to change the number for which the prime factors are generated.

## Expected Output
```
Prime Factors: [2, 2, 3]
```

## Conclusion
This script generates the sequence of prime factors for a given number.
